# Folder jpeglib

The project imgview uses the jpeg library from https://www.ijg.org to read in
JPEG files. This folder contains all necessary header and library files to
use the library in the version jpeg-9d. If you want to (re-)build the library
for yourself, there are some more files: `build.bat`, `makefile.tcc` and
`jconfig.tcc`. Additionally there's a Visual Studio 2019 project file
`jpeg-9d.vcxproj`.
