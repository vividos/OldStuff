2003-03-01 - miscellaneous work

  Beautified some code and added autoconf/automake stuff. Added a Mingw32
  make file.

2003-02-13 - new Win32 CVS repository

  I set up a local CVS repository using TortoiseCVS to work on altpng. Old
  project files are used, but a new folder structure. Win32 specific examples
  and test projects are gone. I'll do a SDL PNG viewer instead. pngmin
  remains.

2002-10-10 - changed name to altpng

  I changed the name of the library and all prefixes to altpng, to avoid
  confusion with the libpng library.

2002-01-28 - started pnglib CVS repository

  today I've set up a local CVS repository for pnglib.
