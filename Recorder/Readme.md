## Technical Background ##

The application is a WinCE project that must be opened and compiled using
either eMbedded Visual C++ 4.0 (still available here:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=16683) or Visual
Studio 2008 with the PocketPC 2003 SDK or the Windows Mobile 6 SDK installed.

The application most probably won't compile at this point, as there are some
files missing. The project also uses an early version of Boost and an early
version of UlibCpp that has some WinCE specific classes.
