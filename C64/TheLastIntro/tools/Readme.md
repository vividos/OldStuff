# Tools

In order to compile and run the intro, you need to download and extract two
packages:

- cc65 compiler: Place the current snapshot of the cc65 compiler into the
  folder tools/cc65, the ca65.exe should be in tools/cc65/bin/ca65.exe
- WinVICE emulator: place the latest version of winVice into the folder
  tools/winVICE, the c1541.exe should be in tools/winVICE/c1541.exe

Note that the "pucrunch" folder already contains the needed pucrunch.exe.
